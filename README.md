This repository includes my project, done during a Data Science Training + Internship Program at Techsmart System Pune, India.
 
In addition to the internship, I demonstrated the implementation of commonly used Classification Algorithms which include
1. K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Logistic Regression
The Jupyter-Notebook for the same is already uploaded.
